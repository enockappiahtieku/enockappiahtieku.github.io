I research language change, focusing on understanding its mechanisms through the interaction of social, environmental, and cognitive factors. I use multidisciplinary approaches, including evolutionary biology and computational linguistics methods, to address these questions. Currently, I investigate quantity expressions from an evolutionary perspective, examining these resource for expressing quantity have evolved across different cultures over the last 5,000 years. Since 2022, I have been undertaking doctoral research at the Department of Linguistics and Cultural Evolution of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. My doctoral work intersects with an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, psychologists, and cognitivists. Together we aim to uncover the fundamental patterns in our evolved capacity for number cognition.
